# DeFi-Decentralized-Finance
The primary focus of this project was to create a Defi app using the Ethereum blockchain, which operates on a decentralized network of nodes. We utilized the Dai token, which is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and security to our app's financial transactions.
